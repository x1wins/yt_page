Can the pros figure out who is cheating, or will the imposter be able to Craft A Lie? \n\nCREDITS: \nEditing: @kirasfrogs \n\nAdditional thanks to\n@biggestbee \n\nPlayers:\nHax: https://www.youtube.com/@hackingnoises https://www.twitch.tv/hackingnoisess\nFeinberg: https://www.youtube.com/@FeinbergMC https://www.twitch.tv/feinberg\nInfume : https://www.youtube.com/@infumemc  https://www.twitch.tv/infume\nSilverr: https://www.youtube.com/@silverrruns https://www.twitch.tv/silverrruns\nMongey: https://www.youtube.com/@bigbigmongey https://www.twitch.tv/bigbigmongey\nDarvy: https://www.youtube.com/@darvy_x1 https://www.twitch.tv/darvyyx1\nErik: https://www.youtube.com/@Erikfzf https://www.twitch.tv/erikfzf\nAltoid: https://www.youtube.com/@justaltoid https://www.twitch.tv/justaltoid\nEmerald: https://www.youtube.com/@nEmerald https://www.twitch.tv/n3merald\n\nPlease note that this video was filmed in early October and has been in the editing/production process since then. I do not support Tiger and his actions that have come to light since then.\n\nMusic from:\nHollow Knight/Silksong OSTs\nHitman 3 OST\nBloodborne OST\nEnglish Folk Song Suite - Williams\nEpidemic Sound \nPigstep Orchestral Remix by @andreaszoeller \n\nRULES: \n10 players will all be in a private MCSR Ranked lobby. Each round, the slowest player to complete the seed is eliminated*. Secretly, one of the 10 is going to be in creative mode (the imposter) for every round. They will have an additional side task each new round (e.g. place 64 diamond blocks) that they must complete before entering the end fountain. After a seed is played, the remaining players will discuss the seed for 3 minutes and choose to either vote out a player or pass. The player with the most votes will be eliminated; if it is a tie, then no players will be eliminated. If the runners vote out the imposter, they win. If the imposter survives until there is only 1 other runner left, then they win. This time, the imposter unlocks 2 sabotages on Round 2. The sabotages can be used at the beginning of a seed to target a player of the imposter’s choice so long as they did not get first place on the previous seed. All runners are all aware of these sabotage related rules, but are not explicitly told what the sabotages are, thus leaving the imposter with room to lie if they make a mistake.\n\n*There will also be a time limit (15min), so if several runners do not finish the seed, the runner further behind in the splits will be eliminated. If there are several runners stuck in the same split, the slowest player to reach that split will be eliminated; this rule will also be applied to the creative mode runner if they do not finish the seed. \n\n\nSome additional things: \n- Advancements will be on for all players. So the imposter must be careful about doing things too quickly or obtaining random advancements. \n- The creative mode runner is not allowed to use commands or extra saved hotbars. \n- The creative mode runner may choose not to complete the seed, but get far enough into it that they are not eliminated if they notice several runners dying. So, if you see a player not finish a seed, they could still be the imposter."},{"ranking":4,"title":"I Spent $6,900,000 on the Biggest Plane in GTA 5…","channel":"Daaash","channel_id":"UCdtoloDKybNstNxtT38YTAg","published_at":"2026-02-27T20:00:01Z","view_count":136412,"like_count":2112,"favorite_count":0,"comment_count":216,"video_id":"0NT9B8tLKJc","category_id":"20","category_name":"Gaming","tags":"dash,roblox,dash roblox,dash minecraft,minecraft,minecraft mod,I Spent $6900000 on the Biggest Plane in GTA 5…","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0NT9B8tLKJc/default.jpg","description":"I Spent $6,900,000 on the Biggest Plane in GTA 5…\n\nThis video Dash, Baby Dash, and Anne buy a $6.9 MILLION DOLLAR plane in GTA 5, but it's the BIGGEST PLANE in the ENTIRE GAME!

The community controls the developmental direction of Old School RuneScape by voting on which updates it would like to receive.\n\nThe world's largest and most popular MMORPG, Old School RuneScape has been played by over 260 million players since the 2001 release of RuneScape. Old School RuneScape unites the intricate mechanics of modern MMOs with the nostalgic point-and-click gameplay of early role-playing games.\n\nOld School RuneScape is free to download and play, however, the game also offers players the opportunity to purchase in-game items.
