The toys are back and this time, Buzz Lightyear, Woody, Jessie and the rest of the gang's jobs are challenged when they come face-to-face with Lilypad (voice of Greta Lee), a brand-new tablet device that arrives with her own disruptive ideas about what is best for their kid, Bonnie. Will playtime ever be the same?\n \nThe trailer also teases the anticipated reunion of Woody and Buzz following Woody’s decision to leave the gang and start helping lost toys at the end of 2019’s “Toy Story 4.” As the toys face the tech devices of today, it’s going to be all hands on deck with some familiar and all-new characters.\n \nSeveral actors have joined the incredible roster of voice talent including Craig Robinson as Atlas, a cheerful talking GPS hippo toy; Shelby Rabara as the excitable camera toy Snappy; Scarlett Spears as the sweet and shy 8-year-old Bonnie; Mykal-Michelle Harris as Blaze, an independent 8-year-old girl who loves animals; and Matty Matheson as the tech-fearing toy Dr. Nutcase.\n \nAlso rounding out the voice cast are John Ratzenberger as the wisecracking piggybank Hamm; Wallace Shawn as Rex, the anxiety-riddled tyrannosaurus rex toy; Blake Clark as the ever-loyal Slinky Dog; Jeff Bergman as the sarcastic Mr. Potato Head; Anna Vocino as the nurturing Mrs. Potato Head; Annie Potts as the adventure-loving Bo Peep; Bonnie Hunt as the wise rag-doll Dolly; Melissa Villaseñor as Karen Beverly, Bonnie’s homemade toy fashioned out of a plastic knife; John Hopkins as the dignified hedgehog plush toy Mr. Pricklepants; Kristen Schaal as the plastic triceratops toy Trixie; Ernie Hudson as the action figure Combat Carl; and Keanu Reeves as Canadian daredevil toy Duke Caboom.\n \nThe previously announced voice cast includes Tom Hanks (Woody), Tim Allen (Buzz Lightyear), Joan Cusack (Jessie), Greta Lee (Lilypad), Conan O’Brien (Smarty Pants) and Tony Hale (Forky).\n \n“Toy Story 5” is directed by Academy Award® winner Andrew Stanton (“WALL•E,” “Finding Nemo,” “Finding Dory”), co-directed by Kenna Harris (“Ciao Alberto”), produced by Lindsey Collins (“Turning Red,” “WALL•E,” “Finding Dory”), and features an original score by Academy Award® winner Randy Newman who returns to score his fifth “Toy Story” feature.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn"},{"ranking":31,"title":"Twenty One Pilots - Drag Path (Official Video)","channel":"twenty one pilots","channel_id":"UCBQZwaNPFfJ1gZ1fLZpAEGw","published_at":"2026-02-17T23:02:14Z","view_count":3873984,"like_count":274458,"favorite_count":0,"comment_count":11852,"video_id":"m0BFZkPsoWY","category_id":"10","category_name":"Music","tags":"twenty one pilots,twenty one pilots official,drag path,digital remains,drag path official video,drag path leak,twenty one pilots you found me,breach album,drag path edit,you found me,dragpath,drag path tiktok,twenty one pilots 2026,new twenty one pilots,breach digital remains,drag path lyrics,drag path reaction","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m0BFZkPsoWY/default.jpg","description":"Official video for “Drag Path\" available now. \n\nStream \"Drag Path\": https://top.lnk.to/DragPath\n\nWriter, Director, Storyboards: Tobias Gundorff Boesen\nAnimation: Katrine Poulsen, Tobias Gundorff Boesen, Frederik Villumsen, Christophe Peladan\nArt Direction and Design: Tobias Gundorff Boesen\nLead Photography and Light: Andreas Berg, Martin Bested\nPhotography, Light: Tobias Gundorff Boesen, Emil Tvilum Toft\nCharacter Development: Tobias Gundorff Boesen, Katrine Poulsen, Frederik Villumsen\nStop Motion Puppets: Tobias Gundorff Boesen, Katrine Poulsen\nPuppet Assistants: Hiromi Scintu, Jakob Kousholt\nGrip, Armatures, Props: Gert Gundorff, Tobias Gundorff Boesen\nCostumier: Birgit Kousholt\nFur Costumier: Majken Jakobsen\nEditing, Compositing, VFX: Tobias Gundorff Boesen\nColor: Tobias Gundorff Boesen, Martin Bested, Andreas Berg\nFoley, Sound Design: Thomas Ahlmark\nStory Supervisor: Tod Polson\nStop Motion Supervisor, Stage Magician: Christophe Peladan\nTechnical Supervisor: Sunith Parekh Gaihede\nPuppet Consultants: Hannah Habermann, Anja Perl\nTech Support: Svend Nordby, Thomas Ahlmark, Jeppe Lindstrøm, Thomas Christensen, Henrik Adolfsen\nProducer: Michelle Nardone\nAssistant Producers: Katrine Talks, Henrik Malmgren\nMade at The Animation Workshop: animationworkshop.via.dk\n\nSubscribe for more official content from Twenty One Pilots: https://top.lnk.to/subscribe  \nSite: https://TOP.lnk.to/website \nStore: https://TOP.lnk.to/store \nSpotify: https://TOP.lnk.to/spotify \nApple Music: https://TOP.lnk.to/apple \nAmazon Music: https://TOP.lnk.to/amazon \nInstagram: https://TOP.lnk.to/instagram \nTwitter: https://TOP.lnk.to/twitter \nFacebook: https://TOP.lnk.to/facebook \nTikTok: https://TOP.lnk.to/tiktok \nYouTube: https://TOP.lnk.to/youtube\n\n#TwentyOnePilots #DragPath"},{"ranking":32,"title":"Forged in Fury | Shyvana Champion Update Trailer - League of Legends","channel":"League of Legends","channel_id":"UC2t5bjwHdUX4vM2g8TRDq5g","published_at":"2026-02-27T16:00:59Z","view_count":829659,"like_count":40500,"favorite_count":0,"comment_count":1859,"video_id":"Xoq33mAQFlg","category_id":"20","category_name":"Gaming","tags":"Riot Games,Riot,League of Legends,League,LoL,MOBA,league of legends,league,lol,league cinematic,league of legends cinematic,league season 1 cinematic,league season 1,league of legends cg,lol cinematic,lol cg,league lore,league lore cinematic,demacia,shyvana,shyvana gameplay,league shyvana rework,league shyvana update,shyvana vgu,shyvana rework,league of legends shyvana,lol shyvana,shyvana cinematic,the half dragon,for demacia,jarvan iv,jarvan","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xoq33mAQFlg/default.jpg","description":"Do not fear the fire within.

Each round, the slowest player to complete the seed is eliminated*. Secretly, one of the 10 is going to be in creative mode (the imposter) for every round. They will have an additional side task each new round (e.g. place 64 diamond blocks) that they must complete before entering the end fountain. After a seed is played, the remaining players will discuss the seed for 3 minutes and choose to either vote out a player or pass. The player with the most votes will be eliminated; if it is a tie, then no players will be eliminated. If the runners vote out the imposter, they win. If the imposter survives until there is only 1 other runner left, then they win. This time, the imposter unlocks 2 sabotages on Round 2. The sabotages can be used at the beginning of a seed to target a player of the imposter’s choice so long as they did not get first place on the previous seed. All runners are all aware of these sabotage related rules, but are not explicitly told what the sabotages are, thus leaving the imposter with room to lie if they make a mistake.\n\n*There will also be a time limit (15min), so if several runners do not finish the seed, the runner further behind in the splits will be eliminated. If there are several runners stuck in the same split, the slowest player to reach that split will be eliminated; this rule will also be applied to the creative mode runner if they do not finish the seed. \n\n\nSome additional things: \n- Advancements will be on for all players. So the imposter must be careful about doing things too quickly or obtaining random advancements. \n- The creative mode runner is not allowed to use commands or extra saved hotbars. \n- The creative mode runner may choose not to complete the seed, but get far enough into it that they are not eliminated if they notice several runners dying. So, if you see a player not finish a seed, they could still be the imposter."},{"ranking":76,"title":"December 10 - Run My Way (Official Video)","channel":"December 10","channel_id":"UCmi3wJetgZxqKQ578pLU3jw","published_at":"2026-01-30T16:00:06Z","view_count":1911964,"like_count":31994,"favorite_count":0,"comment_count":3996,"video_id":"kvGfRQx7eu4","category_id":"10","category_name":"Music","tags":"december 10,december10,december ten,december 10 band,december 10 boy band,simon cowell band,simon cowell boy band,simon cowell the next act,the next act simon cowell,the next act boy band,one direction,d10,josh december 10,john december 10,hendrik december 10,danny december 10,sean december 10,nic december 10,nicolas december 10,cruz december 10,December10 run my way,run my way,Run my way live,run my way lyrics,D10 Run My Way","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kvGfRQx7eu4/default.jpg","description":"Our first single, Run My Way is out now! https://december10.lnk.to/RunMyWay\nListen to Run My Way Stripped here: https://december10.lnk.to/RunMyWayStripped\n\nFollow December 10:\nInstagram -

prison.\nSo if you share my vision,\nThank me, dear, for paradise.\n\nAnd in the hour of joy,\nDon’t bite the hand that feeds you, child.\nOr do I have to fix you?\n‘Cuz once I do, you’ll never die.\n\nI can make you better,\nI can make you right.\nMaybe now, you’ll see reason from the wrong side out.\n\n(A child’s what they, child’s what they, child’s what they made you.\nA child’s what they, child’s what they, child’s what they made you.)\n\nI gave us new life,\nThrough reanimation.\nBut you brought an outlier to my equation,\nSo shall we see what you look like?\n\nI can make you better,\nI can make you right.\nMaybe now, you’ll see reason from the wrong side out.\nI’ll stitch you together,\nAnd you’ll get lost in the white.\nMaybe now, you’ll feel freedom from the wrong side out.\n\n(TELL ME WHO I AM! DON’T PUT ME IN THE BOX! I’LL BE GOOD I’LL BE GOOD!)\nBut a child’s what they made you.\n(TELL ME WHO I AM! DON’T PUT ME IN THE BOX! I’LL BE GOOD I’LL BE GOOD!)\nBut a child’s what they made you.\n\nYou can’t burn down all that we are,\nOr turn around,\nThis is the start of my immortal perfection.\nAnd I’m your God.\n\nI can make you better,\nI can make you right.\nMaybe now, you’ll see reason from the wrong side out.\n\nI’ll stitch you together,\nAnd you’ll get lost in the white.\nMaybe now, you’ll feel freedom from the wrong side out.\n\n(TELL ME WHO I AM! DON’T PUT ME IN THE BOX! I’LL BE GOOD I’LL BE GOOD!)\nBut a child’s what they made you."},{"ranking":111,"title":"Disarming A Bomb With Jynxzi Is IMPOSSIBLE.","channel":"Joe Bart Games","channel_id":"UCeBPTBz1oRnsWsUBnKNNKNw","published_at":"2026-02-22T18:21:21Z","view_count":1250358,"like_count":35122,"favorite_count":0,"comment_count":1957,"video_id":"i4sWgov4sWU","category_id":"20","category_name":"Gaming","tags":"joebartolozzi","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i4sWgov4sWU/default.jpg","description":"TRY OUT GAMER SUPPS AND USE CODE: Bart FOR 10% OFF AND FREE SHIPPING: https://gamersupps.gg/bart\n\n☆Socials:\n➥ Main Channel: https://www.youtube.com/@JoeBartolozzi\n➥ Philosophy Channel: https://www.youtube.com/@Joe-Bart-Philosophy\n➥ Vod Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-lfGGqb5hHLBqVnVnWyrsw\n➥Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/joe_bartolozzi\n➥Twitter: https://twitter.com/joebartolozzi_?lang=en\n➥ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/joe.bartolozzi/?hl=en\n\n\nEditor\n@Jdyo \nThumbnails: https://twitter.com/KangWitK\n\n☆Discord:\n➥https://discord.gg/joebart\n\nOutro Song:  @PlayaPhonkOfficial   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oC_WYWJx9A"},{"ranking":112,"title":"Huggy Wuggy is Dead - Poppy Playtime Chapter 5","channel":"special edd","channel_id":"UCel2B-6wZhvQHRAKXmpm1Ew","published_at":"2026-02-27T22:33:58Z","view_count":798412,"like_count":30873,"favorite_count":0,"comment_count":3887,"video_id":"x-oyEKhsK9o","category_id":"20","category_name":"Gaming","tags":"eddievr,mexican youtuber,horror,funny,meme,babies,funny moments,the boys,poppy playtime,chapter 5","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x-oyEKhsK9o/default.jpg","description":"huggy wuggy has seen better days muchachos\n\nOur New Comic! http://get.green-gang.com\nNew HOT SAUCE: https://www.hungryboy.food\n\nSocials:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sauceddie\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/sauceddie\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@sauceddie\n\nMy friends: \nMully: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClS6zI81d6YaDy7yLjrCzEw \nJuicy: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_YkukM6o3D3GiKnFXLq0vQ\nJosh: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK0VozPhniGe4Eb2zcju1uw\nNarrator: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAYfH3griedXBdJX0awJTCg\nGabriela: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9ho8fNWiCNRvzD-CskZl7A\n\nEdited by: Oli B https://x.com/Im_Oli_B"},{"ranking":113,"title":"Jynxzi & Stable Ronaldo 2V2 Every Rank In Rainbow Six Siege!","channel":"Stable Ronaldo Live","channel_id":"UCLldJScHWCtsFlfanYXS8nQ","published_at":"2026-02-27T04:15:23Z","view_count":195599,"like_count":3955,"favorite_count":0,"comment_count":124,"video_id":"e_MA1tWm64k","category_id":"24","category_name":"Entertainment","tags":"ronaldo,stable ronaldo,stableronaldo,stable ronaldo reacts,stable ronaldo live,jasontheween,kai cenat,faze,jasontheween live,plaqueboymax,ludwig,adapt,ishowspeed,jynxzi,joe bartolozzi,jynxzi live,jynxzi stable ronaldo,stable ronaldo jynxzi,jynxzi 1v1,rainbow,rainbow six siege,siege,rainbow six,jynxzi r6,r6,stable ronaldo r6,2v2 every rank,r6 every rank,jynxzi plays every rank,jynxzi every rank,2V2 Every Rank In Rainbow Six Seige,jynxzi rainbow six siege","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e_MA1tWm64k/default.jpg","description":"Subscribe to never miss a video! https://bit.ly/2O0xqkX​\n\n🔴 twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/StableRonaldo\n▶️ twitter: https://www.twitter.com/StableRonaldo​​​\n📸 instagram: https://www.instagram.com/stableronaldo\n► Subscribe to the Main Channel! https://bit.ly/3if8vnH​​\n📥 send me stuff: po box 2459 Van Nuys CA 91404\n\n► Channel Manager/Editor:\nhttps://twitter.com/SiggyGG"},{"ranking":114,"title":"OpTic TEXAS vs LA THIEVES!!

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms."},{"ranking":124,"title":"Evolving my Dog in Minecraft","channel":"Craftee","channel_id":"UCKGNVB2moP-zeAWPmw8HvAA","published_at":"2026-02-17T15:00:02Z","view_count":1063633,"like_count":4646,"favorite_count":0,"comment_count":218,"video_id":"0xYWsOK0UG8","category_id":"20","category_name":"Gaming","tags":"minecraft,minecraft but,new minecraft,craftee,craft,crafter,crafty,crafting,crafting recipe,crafting in minecraft,minecraft update,survival,how to survive,caves and cliffs,caves and cliffs update,new minecraft channel,diamonds,ender dragon,custom,diamond,minecraft mod,minecraft challenge,minecraft funny,minecraft 1.20,minecraft 1.20 update,minecraft mods,custom minecraft,mod,mods,custom mob,Evolving as a Dog,Dog,Wolf","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0xYWsOK0UG8/default.jpg","description":"Evolving my Dog in Minecraft!\n\n✅ Biome Pets Add On 1.3 ➡️  https://cutt.ly/CFTBiomePetsAO\n\n✅ AFK Farms Add On 1.1 ➡️ https://cutt.ly/AFKFarmsCFT1_1\n\n✅ Death Animations Add On 1.2 ➡️ https://cutt.ly/DeathAnimsCFT\n\n👕 Get some *OFFICIAL* Craftee Merch! ➡️ http://craftee.store/\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n#Minecraft #Craftee #Gaming\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\n🎶 Music courtesy of Epidemic Sound\n📜 All music used with permission from its creator.\n\n0:00 Evolving my Dog in Minecraft\n1:35 Entering the Lab\n4:23 Becoming an Adult Dog\n5:37 Communication Collar\n8:26 Give a Dog a Bone\n9:56 Wilderness Survival\n11:51 Cave Survival \n13:50 Searching for a Home\n16:20 Abandoned Village\n18:51 Becoming the Moss Boss Dog?\n21:05 Returning Home\n24:41 Payback Time\n27:00 Infiltrating the Vault \n29:42 Becoming the Alpha Wolf"},{"ranking":125,"title":"Exploring a Forgotten World In Minecraft…","channel":"PrestonPlayz","channel_id":"UCJZam2u1G0syq3kyqrCXrNw","published_at":"2026-02-28T15:15:00Z","view_count":678795,"like_count":12587,"favorite_count":0,"comment_count":1373,"video_id":"6NTVYDdE5a0","category_id":"20","category_name":"Gaming","tags":"minecraft,preston,brianna,gaming,funny,ssundee,unspeakable,mrbeast,aphmau,canman,lankybox,cash minecraft,nico mc,stokestwins,gametoons,maizen,eyestreem,exploring a forgotten world in minecraft,exploring a forgotten world","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6NTVYDdE5a0/default.jpg","description":"❇️Need new glasses?

The earliest settlers braved wars and disasters, and through more than 150 years of relentless effort, they carved out a foothold and laid out a new foundation for humanity — the Civilization Band. Yet most of this world remains untamed. Vast wildlands and uninhabited territories stretching toward the horizon still await exploration. Every step forward is shadowed by threats — whether remnants of the past or dangers never before seen.\n\nExpansion and exploration, as well as continuity and progression, are the eternal themes throughout the evolution of civilization, and the ultimate pursuit of every life that constitutes it.\n\nAs the Endministrator of Endfield Industries, you will lead your operators to defend and expand the frontiers of humanity. Your Originium engines rumble in the wildlands while production machinery works around the clock to deploy new AIC Factory production lines. Explore the world of Talos-II and gather various resources. Use the AIC Factory to overcome dangers and work with the operators to build a better homeland for humanity.\n\nA new era of change has dawned upon this ancient world. Time to make your choice, Endministrator."},{"ranking":192,"title":"Fortnite SEASON 2 LIVE EVENT Explained!","channel":"Top5Gaming","channel_id":"UCYn6CZe5UGIyPe9WJb0pTrg","published_at":"2026-02-24T22:39:18Z","view_count":394587,"like_count":10179,"favorite_count":0,"comment_count":457,"video_id":"E1VkCPyWCFQ","category_id":"20","category_name":"Gaming","tags":"fortnite,Fortnite SEASON 2 LIVE EVENT - Everything You Need to Know!,fortnite live event,live event fortnite,fortnite season 2 event,fortnite season 2 live event,fortnite new event,new event fortnite,season 2 live event fortnite,season 2 live event,live event season 2,fortnite new season,new fortnite season,fortnite new season event,fortnite season 2,fortnite new,new fortnite,fortnite update,fortnite new update,fort,nite,battle royale,new,update,video","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E1VkCPyWCFQ/default.jpg","description":"Fortnite SEASON 2 LIVE EVENT - Everything You Need to Know!\nItem Shop Code: T5G #UseCodeT5G #fortnite #epicpartner \n\nFollow us on Instagram & Twitter to be informed when we post:\nhttps://twitter.com/Top5Gamingx\nhttps://www.instagram.com/top5gamingx/\n\nCheck out our Other Fortnite Videos Here\n\nFortnite Just LEAKED 2026!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoIDuL4exnI\n\nOur FIRST LOOK At Fortnite Season 2!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Bm6mWrGsQI\n\n50 Secrets & Easter Eggs In Fortnite!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SBO6DanZIM\n\nFortnite CHAPTER 7 - EVERYTHING NEW!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAj53FFkLX0\n\nNotice: We earn revenue from you supporting us in the Fortnite Item Shop.
